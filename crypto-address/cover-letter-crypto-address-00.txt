Subject: I-D Action: draft-zzn-crypto-address-00 - DNS-Based Crypto Address Resolution Using CAIP-10
From: Zainan (Victor) Zhou <zzn@namefi.io>

Dear DNSOP Working Group,

I am pleased to submit the Internet-Draft "DNS-Based Crypto Address Resolution Using CAIP-10" (draft-zzn-crypto-address-00) for your consideration and feedback.

This draft addresses the growing need for standardized cryptocurrency address resolution through DNS. With the rapid expansion of blockchain ecosystems, users face increasing complexity in managing addresses across multiple chains. This draft proposes a DNS-based resolution mechanism that is both cross-chain compatible and backward compatible with existing DNS infrastructure.

Key aspects of the proposal include:

1. CAIP-10 Format Adoption
   - Utilizes the Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal 10 (CAIP-10) format for encoding blockchain addresses
   - Provides native multi-chain support covering 150+ blockchain networks
   - Ensures future compatibility with emerging blockchain networks

2. Prefixed TXT Record Transition Mechanism
   - Implements the transition mechanism defined in draft-zzn-dns-new-rr-00
   - Uses "RFC9999" prefixed TXT records until WALLET RR type is widely supported
   - Establishes clear migration path to dedicated WALLET RR type

3. Apex-Level Resolution Strategy
   - Places records at domain apex level rather than specialized subdomains
   - Maintains DNS hierarchy simplicity and CNAME compatibility
   - Avoids namespace fragmentation issues

4. Optional DNSSEC Implementation
   - Recommends but does not require DNSSEC to balance security and adoption
   - Defines clear validation rules for both prefixed TXT and WALLET RR formats
   - Provides compatibility with ENS DNSSEC Oracle for on-chain verification

5. Blockchain-Delegated Reverse Resolution
   - Deliberately leaves reverse resolution mechanisms to blockchain governance
   - Respects the diverse technical requirements of different chains
   - Enables chain-specific PTR-like mechanisms using blockchain-controlled domains

Industry data shows that 82% of crypto wallets now support some form of DNS-based lookups, yet implementation fragmentation creates significant interoperability challenges. This proposal aims to reduce these issues while providing a secure and future-proof standard.

I would appreciate the working group's feedback particularly on:
1. The use of CAIP-10 as the base format for cross-chain compatibility
2. The prefixed TXT record approach and migration strategy
3. The balance between security requirements and adoption practicality
4. The delegation of reverse resolution to blockchain governance

Regarding related work, we acknowledge the valuable contributions of draft-chins-dnsop-web3-wallet-mapping-02 in establishing initial wallet mapping patterns. While both drafts aim to solve similar problems, our approach differs in several key areas:

1. We adopt CAIP-10 for cross-chain compatibility instead of SLIP-0044's Bitcoin-centric model
2. We recommend rather than require DNSSEC to accommodate current adoption levels
3. We use apex-level resolution rather than specialized subdomains
4. We deliberately delegate reverse resolution to blockchain governance

These differences reflect our focus on the evolving multi-chain landscape while maintaining core DNS principles. We believe a separate RFC is warranted to properly address these different design choices, though we welcome collaboration with the authors of draft-chins to harmonize approaches.

Since it's datatracker closing window before IETF-122, a version is published on https://github.com/xinbenlv/rfc-drafts/blob/31e168288333ca7d9b74dad6bdfbb542c631dcc8/crypto-address/draft-zzn-crypto-address-00.txt#L1, will submit once the window opens on Mar 15 or earlier if facilitated by chair/admin of the WG.

Sincerely,
